"""
Simple example that connects to one crazyflie (check the address at the top
and update it to your crazyflie address) and send a sequence of setpoints,
one every 5 seconds.

This example is intended to work with the Loco Positioning System in TWR TOA
mode. It aims at documenting how to set the Crazyflie in position control mode
and how to send setpoints.
